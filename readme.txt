There are a few cases when manually installing a WordPress Plugin is appropriate.

    2. If your server does not permit automatic installation of a WordPress Plugin.
    3. The WordPress Plugin is not in the WordPress Plugins Directory.

= Updating =
Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
